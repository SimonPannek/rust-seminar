A paper about Rust for Network Servers.

_Abstract: Software  running  on  network  servers  is  a  commontarget of malicious attacks trying to cause outages or leakage ofuser data. Oftentimes memory unsafety caused by human errorwhen developing the application can be the reason for such issuesto  occur  in  the  first  place.Therefore this paper focuses on the benefits of using Rust whendeploying a backend for a service and how basic communicationusing  the  TCP  and  UDP  protocols  can  look  like,  both  usingsynchronous and asynchronous implementations as well as takinga  look  at  the  deployment  of  Rust  on  the  application  layer.Index  Termsâ€”rust,  computer  network,  tcp  communication_
