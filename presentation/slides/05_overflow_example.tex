        \item Let us take a step back: Currently, many networking libraries are written in C or C++
        \item Is there any problem with this piece of code?
        \item Buffer overflow attacks (Small explanation what can happen)
        \item No guaranteed memory safety in C and C++
        \item Mistakes of a programmer are not checked by the compiler and fall back to some default action (UB \so
        corruption of memory)
        \item Problematic for network applications (many concurrent reads and writes to buffers)
