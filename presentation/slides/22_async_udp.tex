    \centerline{What about Asynchronous UDP communication?}

    \enote{
        \item Tokio offers \rust{tokio::net::UdpSocket} \so works similar to \rust{std::net::UdpSocket}
        \item Porting the synchronous UDP implementation to an asynchronous one works similarly to the TCP client
        \item UDP does not implement actual connections \so waiting for new connections is non-blocking anyway
        \item The advantage of connecting to multiple clients for the asynchronous TCP client is not given for UDP
        \item Client should also send messages? \rust{std::sync::Arc} could be used \so shared ownership to the socket
        (no mutable reference needed for \rust{send_to} and \rust{recv_from})
    }
