        \item Rust can be considered "the best of both worlds":
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Compiled language with a compiler guaranteeing memory- and thread-safety
            \item Fast speed of compiled languages and prevents most of the vulnerabilities mentioned before through
                  its compiler checks
            \item Network operations are prune to failure \so unsafe calls can be wrapped into enums of the type
                  \rust{std::result::Result}
            \item Package manager Cargo
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Let us first take a look how to implement basic TCP and UDP communication in Rust
