    \textbf{The User Datagram Protocol (UDP)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<2-> Commonly used if you do not need reliable delivery of streams
        \item<3-> Tries to send messages to other programs with a minimal amount of protocol mechanism
        \item<4-> No protection against package duplication
        \item<5> No checks whether the data sent has arrived and if it did in what order
    \end{itemize}

    \enote{
        \item UDP is less reliable than the Transmission Control Protocol
        \item No need to listen for new hosts or actively establish a connection
        \item Typical example: Media streaming (package loss is acceptable)
    }
