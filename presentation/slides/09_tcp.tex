    \textbf{The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<2-> Active connection between two systems
        \item<3-> Can be used to send a continous stream of octets to another host
        \item<4-> A sequence number is assigned to each octet in order to confirm it was received
        \item<5> If no acknowledgment (ACK) was received, the data is sent again
    \end{itemize}

    \enote{
        \item TCP is used for reliable inter-process communication between two systems connected through a network
        \item The sequence number can also be used to eliminate duplicates
    }
