    \centerline{Rust is a very powerful language for writing network applications}

    \enote{
        \item Often important to deploy a secure and efficient language as a backend
        \item Underlying services can be considered the bottleneck most of the times
        \item Slowing down or outages should be avoided
        \item Security vulnerabilites can cause interruption of service or accidental disclosure of sensible user data
        \item Rust's compile time checks can avoid many common security issues
        \item Shifting checks into the process of compiling the code removes checking at runtime, making executables
        even faster
