    Software running on network servers is a common target of malicious attacks trying to cause outages or
    leakage of user data. Oftentimes memory unsafety caused by human error when developing the application can be the reason for
    such issues to occur in the first place.

    Therefore this paper focuses on the benefits of using Rust when deploying a backend for a service and how basic
    communication using the TCP and UDP protocols can look like, both using synchronous and asynchronous
    implementations. Furthermore the deployment of Rust on the application layer is explained.
